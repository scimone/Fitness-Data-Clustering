# Interactive Fitness Data Clustering Dashboard
This repository hosts a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook-based dashboard designed to facilitate interactive exploration and comparison of clustering algorithms using the Altair visualization library.

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to provide users with an intuitive tool for analyzing clustering outcomes, fine-tuning clustering parameters, detecting anomalies, and gaining insights into potential causes of misclassification within their datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset contains recordings from a garmin activity tracker watch. Depending on the activity type, the device measures different attributes (e.g. Max HR, Elev Gain, ...). The activities were recorded between 5th of April 2018 and 4th of December 2020 and include various types (e.g. Running, Cycling, Swimming, etc.). The data has been downloaded as `.csv` file from the Garmin Connect Cloud.


## Content
The notebook covers the following key components:

0. Import Libraries
1. Load and Preprocess Data
2. Descriptive Statistics
3. Explore Correlations
4. Implement Dimension Reduction Techniques
5. Implement Clustering Algorithms
6. Conclusion


## Opening the dashboard
To use the dashboard, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (dashboard.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Follow the interactive sections to load the dataset, visualize clustering outcomes, and explore attribute correlations.
